# Machine Learning Methods â€“ Lab Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of lab notebooks focused on supervised machine learning techniques. Each notebook explores a specific algorithm or workflow through structured experimentation and analysis.

## Contents

- `NN_Lab.ipynb`: Implementation and experimentation with a basic neural network.
- `SVM_Lab.ipynb`: Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, including kernel variations.
- `Trees_AdaBoost_Lab.ipynb`: Comparison between decision trees and boosting methods using AdaBoost.
- `KPCA_SVR_Lab.ipynb`: Dimensionality reduction via Kernel PCA followed by regression with SVR (Support Vector Regression).

## Objectives

- Experiment with classical and advanced supervised learning models.
- Study the impact of transformations such as kernel mapping and dimensionality reduction.
- Evaluate model performance and limitations using synthetic and real datasets.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
